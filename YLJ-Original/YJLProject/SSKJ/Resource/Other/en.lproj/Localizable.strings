Bitcoin network releases a certain amount of money every 10 minutes. It is expected to reach its limit in 2140. Bitcoin is called digital gold by investors. Bitcoin is produced by a large number of calculations according to a specific algorithm, which does not lead the issuance of specific monetary institutions. It uses a distributed database composed of many nodes in the whole P2P network to confirm and record all transactions, and uses cryptographic design to ensure the security of all links of currency circulation, which can ensure that the value of currency can not be manipulated artificially by a large number of Bitcoins. The cryptographic design allows Bitcoin to be transferred, paid and cashed only by the real owner. It also ensures the anonymity of currency ownership and circulation transactions.";
